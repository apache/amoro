description: 'Fix docker-java API version for Testcontainers'
runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - name: 'Docker version info'
      shell: bash
      run: |
        docker version
        docker info

    # Workaround: Docker Engine 29+ requires API ≥ 1.44, but docker-java
    # (used by Testcontainers) negotiates with 1.32 which gets rejected.
    # docker-java reads ~/.docker-java.properties at startup.
    # Remove this step once Testcontainers ships a docker-java version
    # that negotiates properly (track: https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/11212)
