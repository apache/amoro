      <description>Catalogs Introduce multi-catalog A catalog is a metadata namespace that stores information about databases, tables, views, indexes, users, and UDFs. It provides a higher-level namespace for table and database. Typically, a catalog is associated with a specific type of data source or cluster. In Flink, Spark and Trino, the multi-catalog feature can be used to support SQL across data sources, such as:&#xA;SELECT c.ID, c.NAME, c.AGE, o.AMOUNT FROM ${CATALOG_A}.ONLINE.CUSTOMERS c JOIN ${CATALOG_B}.</description>

      <description>Table Configurations Multi-level configuration management Amoro provides configurations that can be configured at the Catalog, Table, and Engine levels. The configuration priority is given first to the Engine, followed by the Table, and finally by the Catalog.&#xA;Catalog: Generally, we recommend users to set default values for tables through the Catalog properties configuration, such as Self-optimizing related configurations. Table: We also recommend users to specify customized configurations when Create Table, which can also be modified through Alter Table operations.</description>

      <description>Managing Optimizers The optimizer is the execution unit for performing self-optimizing tasks on a table. To isolate optimizing tasks on different tables and support the deployment of optimizers in different environments, Amoro has proposed the concepts of optimizer containers and optimizer groups:&#xA;Optimizer container: Encapsulate the deployment method of optimizers, there are four implementations for now: flink container based on Flink streaming job, spark container based on Spark job, local container based on Java Application, and external container based on manually started by users.</description>

      <description>Mixed-Hive Format Mixed-Hive format is a format that has better compatibility with Hive than Mixed-Iceberg format. Mixed-Hive format uses a Hive table as the BaseStore and an Iceberg table as the ChangeStore. Mixed-Hive format supports:&#xA;schema, partition, and types consistent with Hive format Using the Hive connector to read and write Mixed-Hive format tables as Hive tables Upgrading a Hive table in-place to a Mixed-Hive format table without data rewriting or migration, with a response time in seconds All the functional features of Mixed-Iceberg format The structure of Mixed-Hive format is shown below:</description>

      <description>Formats Overview Table format (aka. format) was first proposed by Iceberg, which can be described as follows:&#xA;It defines the relationship between tables and files, and any engine can query and retrieve data files according to the table format. New formats such as Iceberg/Delta/Hudi further define the relationship between tables and snapshots, and the relationship between snapshots and files. All write operations on the table will generate new snapshots, and all read operations on the table are based on snapshots.</description>

      <description>Self-optimizing Introduction Lakehouse is characterized by its openness and loose coupling, with data and files maintained by users through various engines. While this architecture appears to be well-suited for T+1 scenarios, as more attention is paid to applying Lakehouse to streaming data warehouses and real-time analysis scenarios, challenges arise. For example:&#xA;Streaming writes bring a massive amount of fragment files CDC ingestion and streaming updates generate excessive redundant data Using the new data lake format leads to orphan files and expired snapshots.</description>

      <description>Table Watermark Table freshness Data freshness represents timeliness, and in many discussions, freshness is considered one of the important indicators of data quality. In traditional offline data warehouses, higher cost typically means better performance, creating a typical binary paradox in terms of cost-performance trade-off. However, in high-freshness streaming data warehouses, massive small files and frequent updates can lead to performance degradation. The higher the freshness, the greater the impact on performance.</description>

      <description>Using Customized Encryption Method for Configurations To enhance security, AMS allows encrypted sensitive configuration items such as passwords. Currently, AMS only supports the built-in base64 encryption algorithm (see Configure encrypted configuration items for details). If you require a stronger or customized encryption method, AMS also provides the flexibility to implement your own encryption algorithm.&#xA;Develop the Custom Implementation To integrate a custom encryption algorithm, you need to create a Java class that implements the ConfigShade interface and package it as a service.</description>

      <description>Using Logstore Due to the limitations of traditional offline data warehouse architectures in supporting real-time business needs, real-time data warehousing has experienced rapid evolution in recent years. In the architecture of real-time data warehousing, Apache Kafka is often used as the storage system for real-time data. However, this also brings about the issue of data disconnection between offline data warehouses.&#xA;Developers often need to pay attention to data stored in HDFS as well as data in Kafka, which increases the complexity of business development.</description>
