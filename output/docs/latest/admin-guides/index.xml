      <description>Managing Optimizers The optimizer is the execution unit for performing self-optimizing tasks on a table. To isolate optimizing tasks on different tables and support the deployment of optimizers in different environments, Amoro has proposed the concepts of optimizer containers and optimizer groups:&#xA;Optimizer container: Encapsulate the deployment method of optimizers, there are four implementations for now: flink container based on Flink streaming job, spark container based on Spark job, local container based on Java Application, and external container based on manually started by users.</description>

      <description>Using Customized Encryption Method for Configurations To enhance security, AMS allows encrypted sensitive configuration items such as passwords. Currently, AMS only supports the built-in base64 encryption algorithm (see Configure encrypted configuration items for details). If you require a stronger or customized encryption method, AMS also provides the flexibility to implement your own encryption algorithm.&#xA;Develop the Custom Implementation To integrate a custom encryption algorithm, you need to create a Java class that implements the ConfigShade interface and package it as a service.</description>
