      <description>Catalogs Introduce multi-catalog A catalog is a metadata namespace that stores information about databases, tables, views, indexes, users, and UDFs. It provides a higher-level namespace for table and database. Typically, a catalog is associated with a specific type of data source or cluster. In Flink, Spark and Trino, the multi-catalog feature can be used to support SQL across data sources, such as:&#xA;SELECT c.ID, c.NAME, c.AGE, o.AMOUNT FROM MYSQL.ONLINE.CUSTOMERS c JOIN HIVE.</description>

      <description>CDC Ingestion CDC stands for Change Data Capture, which is a broad concept, as long as it can capture the change data, it can be called CDC. Flink CDC is a Log message-based data capture tool, all the inventory and incremental data can be captured. Taking MySQL as an example, it can easily capture Binlog data through Debezium and process the calculations in real time to send them to the data lake.</description>

      <description>Table Configurations Multi-level configuration management Amoro provides configurations that can be configured at the Catalog, Table, and Engine levels. The configuration priority is given first to the Engine, followed by the Table, and finally by the Catalog.&#xA;Catalog: Generally, we recommend users to set default values for tables through the Catalog properties configuration, such as Self-optimizing related configurations. Table: We also recommend users to specify customized configurations when Create Table, which can also be modified through Alter Table operations.</description>

      <description>Formats Overview Table format (aka. format) was first proposed by Iceberg, which can be described as follows:&#xA;It defines the relationship between tables and files, and any engine can query and retrieve data files according to the table format. New formats such as Iceberg/Delta/Hudi further define the relationship between tables and snapshots, and the relationship between snapshots and files. All write operations on the table will generate new snapshots, and all read operations on the table are based on snapshots.</description>

      <description>Self-optimizing Introduction Lakehouse is characterized by its openness and loose coupling, with data and files maintained by users through various engines. While this architecture appears to be well-suited for T+1 scenarios, as more attention is paid to applying Lakehouse to streaming data warehouses and real-time analysis scenarios, challenges arise. For example:&#xA;Streaming writes bring a massive amount of fragment files CDC ingestion and streaming updates generate excessive redundant data Using the new data lake format leads to orphan files and expired snapshots.</description>

      <description>Table Watermark Table freshness Data freshness represents timeliness, and in many discussions, freshness is considered one of the important indicators of data quality. In traditional offline data warehouses, higher cost typically means better performance, creating a typical binary paradox in terms of cost-performance trade-off. However, in high-freshness streaming data warehouses, massive small files and frequent updates can lead to performance degradation. The higher the freshness, the greater the impact on performance.</description>

      <description>Using Logstore Due to the limitations of traditional offline data warehouse architectures in supporting real-time business needs, real-time data warehousing has experienced rapid evolution in recent years. In the architecture of real-time data warehousing, Apache Kafka is often used as the storage system for real-time data. However, this also brings about the issue of data disconnection between offline data warehouses.&#xA;Developers often need to pay attention to data stored in HDFS as well as data in Kafka, which increases the complexity of business development.</description>
