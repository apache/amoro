# Using Kyuubi By Terminal
**Prerequisites**:
- There must be a running Kyuubi. To deploy and run Kyuubi, please refer to [Kyuubi doc](https://kyuubi.readthedocs.io/en/master/)


Terminal supports interfacing with Kyuubi to submit SQL to Kyuubi for execution. All you need to do is add the Kyuubi configuration as instructed below:
```shell
ams:
    terminal:
      backend: kyuubi
      kyuubi.jdbc.url: jdbc:hive2://127.0.0.1:10009/ # kyuubi Connection Address
```

## Kerberos Authentication
Amoro terminal uses the Kerberos authentication information from the catalog to connect to Kyuubi. When configuring the Kyuubi JDBC URL, you only need to configure the connection information and do not need to configure Kerberos authentication information (e.g. principal).

Without configuring Kyuubi, Terminal executes in memory in AMS.

To execute SQL in Terminal, you can refer to the following steps:ï¼š

- Please switch Catalog first
- Before writing SQL, you can use the provided SQL Shortcuts function to help you build SQL quickly.
- Writing SQL
- Click the Execute button to run the SQL;
