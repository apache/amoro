# Helm Chart for Amoro

[Amoro](https://amoro.apache.org) is a Lakehouse management system built on open data lake formats.
Working with compute engines including Flink, Spark, and Trino, Amoro brings pluggable and self-managed features for Lakehouse to provide out-of-the-box data warehouse experience, 
and helps data platforms or products easily build infra-decoupled, stream-and-batch-fused and lake-native architecture.


## Introduction

This chart will bootstrap an [Amoro](https://amoro.apache.org) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io)
cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Requirements

- Kubernetes cluster
- Helm 3.0+

## Template rendering

When you want to test the template rendering, but not actually install anything. [Debugging templates](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/debugging/) provide a quick way of viewing the generated content without YAML parse errors blocking.

There are two ways to render templates. It will return the rendered template to you so you can see the output.

- Local rendering chart templates
```shell
helm template --debug ../amoro
```
- Server side rendering chart templates
```shell
helm install --dry-run --debug --generate-name ../amoro
```
